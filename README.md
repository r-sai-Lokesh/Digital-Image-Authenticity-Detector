# Image Manipulation (Forgery) Detection System
In today's digital age, images are integral to various applications, yet they are vulnerable to forgery. Image forgery involves altering images to conceal or distort information, facilitated by advanced editing tools. Among these techniques, copy-move forgery is prevalent. Our system addresses this challenge by detecting and highlighting such manipulations in digital images. By analyzing image content and identifying inconsistencies, it safeguards the integrity of digital content. This ensures that images maintain their authenticity and reliability, crucial for applications ranging from forensics to journalism. With the rise of digital misinformation, the need for robust forgery detection systems has become more pressing than ever. By providing a reliable means of detecting image manipulations, our system contributes to maintaining trust and accuracy in digital visual content across various domains.

# Digital Image Detection Tool
The repository's forgery detection tool presently incorporates forensic techniques to identify the following:

- Copy-Move 
- CFA-artifacts detection
- Noise-inconsitencies
- Image-Extraction
- For More Detail - contact 245120737167@mvsrec.edu.in

## To Run:
<!-- Place any digital images that you wish to analyze into the **image** folder Present in the Project directory. -->

Navigate to the **Project** directory:
```
$ cd Digital_Image_Detector_System_Python
```

Next, run the **detect.py** script, providing the image you wish to evaluate:
```
$ python GUI.py
```

Once finished, details on the image will be reported in the terminal. Supplemental images generated during copy-move forgery detection can be found in the output directory.
